# WeakTrackingForRosslerSystem
MATLAB code for the shooting method to compute the critical rates for weak tracking in nonautonomous Rossler system. For more detailes see our paper (Alkhayuon and Ashwin 2020) TODO: add arXiv link. 

The movie conn_vs_r155_20 illustrates schematically how the shooting method works.
