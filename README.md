# WeakTrackingForRosslerSystem
MATLAB code for the shooting method to compute the critical rates for weak tracking in nonautonomous Rossler system. For more detailes see our paper (Alkhayuon and Ashwin 2020) download it here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04675 

The movie conn_vs_r155_20 illustrates schematically how the shooting method works.
